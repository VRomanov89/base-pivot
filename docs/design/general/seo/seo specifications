SEO-FIRST WEBSITE CONSTRAINTS

Montreal Real Estate · Local Intelligence Platform

1. Core SEO Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)
Rule #1

Structure beats content volume.
Google rewards clarity, hierarchy, and intent alignment more than frequency.

Rule #2

Every page must answer one primary search intent.
No blended intents. No “catch-all” pages.

Rule #3

Design must support crawling, indexing, and understanding.
If a designer choice hurts clarity, SEO wins.

2. Information Architecture (IA) Constraints
Maximum depth

Important pages must be reachable in ≤ 3 clicks

Blog articles: max depth of 2 from homepage

Required top-level sections

Your site should have no more than 6 primary sections:

/
├── insights/
├── market-brief/
├── tools/
├── neighborhoods/
├── about/
├── contact/


Why:

Clear topical clustering

Predictable crawl paths

Strong internal linking signals

3. URL Structure Rules
Absolute rules

Lowercase only

Hyphens only

No dates in URLs

No query strings for core content

No “blog” in URLs unless it is a blog

Examples (correct)
/insights/montreal-housing-inventory-trends
/insights/rent-vs-buy-montreal
/neighborhoods/plateau-mont-royal-real-estate
/tools/mortgage-affordability-montreal

Examples (forbidden)
/blog?id=123
/2025/03/post-title
/Insights/MontrealMarket

4. Page-Level SEO Constraints (MANDATORY)
One page = one primary keyword theme

Each page must define:

1 primary keyword

2–4 secondary keywords

1 user intent type

Example:
Primary: montreal real estate market trends
Secondary: montreal housing inventory, montreal home prices
Intent: informational

Title tag constraints

50–60 characters

Primary keyword first

Brand name last (optional early on)

Format

Primary Keyword – Context or Insight | Brand


Example:

Montreal Real Estate Market Trends – What’s Changing | Brand

Meta description constraints

140–160 characters

Explain value clearly

No keyword stuffing

Written for humans

Example:

A clear look at Montreal real estate trends, pricing shifts, and what they mean for buyers and investors this year.

Heading hierarchy (STRICT)

Exactly one H1 per page.

Allowed structure:

H1: Primary topic
H2: Major subtopic
H3: Supporting detail
H4: Only if absolutely necessary


Forbidden:

Skipping heading levels

Styling text to “look like” headings

Multiple H1s

5. Content-Length and Depth Constraints
Minimum content thresholds

Core insight articles: 1,200–2,000 words

Neighborhood pages: 1,000–1,500 words

Tool landing pages: 600–1,000 words

Why:

Competitive SERPs require depth

Google evaluates topical completeness, not word count alone

6. Internal Linking System (Very Important)
Rules

Every article must link to:

1 higher-level hub page

2 related articles

Anchor text must be descriptive, not generic

Allowed

“Montreal housing inventory trends”

Forbidden

“Click here”
“Read more”

Hub-and-spoke model (required)

Example:

/insights/montreal-real-estate-market
├── inventory trends
├── interest rates impact
├── buyer vs seller conditions
├── seasonal pricing shifts


This builds topical authority.

7. Neighborhood SEO Constraints (Local Gold)

You must create dedicated neighborhood pages.

Structure
/neighborhoods/plateau-mont-royal-real-estate
/neighborhoods/griffintown-real-estate
/neighborhoods/verdun-real-estate

Each neighborhood page must include:

Overview of area

Housing types

Pricing trends

Buyer profile

Rental considerations

What locals should know

Avoid thin “SEO pages.” These must be genuinely useful.

8. Design Constraints That Impact SEO
Navigation

HTML links only

No JS-only navigation

No hidden nav items

Text visibility

No text embedded in images

No lazy-loaded critical content

No accordion-only pages for core content

Core Web Vitals (SEO-critical)

Design must support:

LCP < 2.5s

CLS < 0.1

INP < 200ms

This means:

No massive hero images

No layout shifts

Fonts loaded properly

Images sized explicitly

9. Image SEO Constraints
Every image must have:

Descriptive filename

Contextual alt text

Example:

montreal-housing-inventory-chart-q1-2025.png
Alt: Montreal housing inventory levels by month

Hero images

Compressed

< 300kb

Use modern formats (WebP/AVIF)

10. Schema and Structured Data (From Day One)

Required schema types:

Organization

Website

Article

Breadcrumb

FAQ (where relevant)

Why:

Improves SERP appearance

Helps Google understand structure

Future-proofs AI search results

11. Editorial & Publishing Constraints
Publishing cadence

Consistency > volume

1 strong article per week beats 5 weak ones

Content rules

No duplicate content

No auto-generated fluff

No regurgitating stats without interpretation

Google rewards original analysis, especially locally.

12. What We Explicitly Do NOT Do

No keyword stuffing

No city name spam

No doorway pages

No “Montreal Real Estate 2025 Guide” clones

No stock SEO templates

13. Measurement and Feedback Loop

From day one, track:

Impressions by page

Average position

Click-through rate

Index coverage

Internal link flow

SEO is iterative, but structure must be correct upfront.

14. Summary Constraint Statement

If a design choice, animation, or copy decision reduces clarity for Google or users, it does not ship.

This mindset alone will put you ahead of 90 percent of real estate sites.
