Brand Guidelines

Option B · Local Intelligence · Conversational

1. Brand Essence
Brand idea

Local intelligence you can actually use.

This is not a listing site.
Not an agent funnel.
Not a hype newsletter.

It is a Montreal-first real estate intelligence platform that helps people make thoughtful decisions by explaining what is happening and why it matters.

Brand promise

Calm, practical insight into Montreal real estate so you can decide with confidence.

What people should feel

Informed, not overwhelmed

Grounded, not rushed

Like they finally understand what they are reading

2. Positioning
How we describe ourselves

A local real estate intelligence platform focused on clarity, context, and better decisions.

What we are

Educational

Analytical but approachable

Local by default

Professional without being stiff

What we are not

A brokerage website

An investment hype machine

A generic “community”

A lead trap disguised as content

3. Voice and Tone
Voice

Conversational, thoughtful, and precise.
You sound like someone who knows the market well and enjoys explaining it clearly.

Tone rules

Write how you would explain this to a smart friend

Prefer clarity over cleverness

Use examples often

Explain implications, not just facts

Language guidelines

Do

“Here’s why this matters”

“What we’re seeing locally”

“This tends to affect buyers more than sellers”

“If you’re thinking about buying, this is the part to pay attention to”

Avoid

“Act now”

“Unprecedented”

“Best time ever”

“Guaranteed returns”

Signature line (reuse everywhere)

Local insight for smarter Montreal real estate decisions.

4. Visual Identity
Overall look

Quiet, confident, modern.
Feels closer to a high-end editorial or fintech product than a real estate site.

8. Data and Credibility Design

This is critical to your brand.

Charts and visuals

Clean, minimal axes

Thin gridlines

No gradients

One accent color only

Always label clearly

Source handling

Whenever market data is referenced:

Cite the source discreetly

Place it at the bottom of the section or chart

Keep it factual and neutral

This quietly builds authority.

9. Imagery Direction
Photography

Real Montreal streets

Buildings, neighborhoods, light, seasons

No staged agent photos

No stock “luxury condo” clichés

Slightly moody, natural light preferred

Illustration

Simple line icons

Editorial diagrams

Framework visuals feel technical but friendly

10. SEO Meets Branding

Brand name stays distinct.
SEO lives in:

Page titles

Headings

Articles

Internal linking

You rank for Montreal real estate by being useful and consistent, not by naming yourself literally.
