Stay fast and stable (Core Web Vitals)

Google’s Core Web Vitals targets to hit from day one: CLS under 0.1 and the CWV guidance is framed around stability and performance.

Technical and SEO constraints for the homepage

One H1 only

All nav and footer links are real <a href> links

Content is server-rendered or statically rendered

Hero image is decorative or small, never heavy

No layout shift on load, set image widths and heights to prevent CLS

Mobile-first, no hidden primary content behind accordions

Internal links support hub-and-spoke structure (home links to hubs, hubs link to articles)

Newsletter flow meets CASL basics, include unsubscribe and identification in emails

Homepage structure and copy
Section 1: Hero

Purpose: clarity + conversion

H1

Neighborhood highlight: “Verdun, Plateau, Rosemont, Griffintown”

Implementation notes

Avoid heavy imagery. Use a subtle Montreal photo only if it is optimized and sized, or use an abstract gradient and UI cards.

Keep hero under 650px height on desktop, 560px on mobile.

Section 2: What this is

Purpose: positioning without sounding like an agent

Headline
Not a listing site. Not a hype newsletter.

Price is only one part of the decision. We break down the tradeoffs that matter: housing stock, walkability, typical buyer profiles, rental demand, and how the market behaves.

Verdun
Rosemont
Griffintown
