Title: Privacy Policy | BrandName

Meta description: How we collect, use, store, and protect personal information on BrandName.

Required sections (MVP-complete)
A. Who we are

Business name

Montreal, Quebec

Contact email for privacy inquiries (even if it is a generic inbox)

“Person in charge of personal information” (Law 25 concept; you can name a role, not necessarily a person)

B. What we collect

Be explicit:

Email address (newsletter)

Name (optional)

Message content (contact forms)

Technical data (IP address, device, analytics events)

C. Why we collect it

Tie each data type to a purpose:

Newsletter delivery

Responding to requests

Improving site performance and content

Security and fraud prevention

D. Consent

State you collect with consent and how users provide it. This aligns with Canadian privacy expectations around consent and transparency (PIPEDA principles).

Quebec guidance emphasizes that a governance policy should include retention and destruction rules. Include a simple MVP version like:

Newsletter subscriber data retained until unsubscribe

Contact form submissions retained for X months (pick a reasonable number like 12–24 months)

Analytics data retained for X months

This aligns with the “retention and destruction” expectation referenced in Quebec summaries.

Email platform (newsletter)

Analytics (if any)

Hosting provider
State: shared only as necessary to deliver the service, not sold.

If you use cookies, say so and provide:

What cookies do (analytics, preferences)

How to manage them

Quebec real estate regulator guidance explicitly mentions cookie banners “where appropriate” and publishing a confidentiality policy.

“Email us at ___ to request access, correction, or deletion.”

I. Safeguards

Short, non-technical but credible:

Access controls

Least privilege
